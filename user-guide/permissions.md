\* Org admins can only delete users who belong to their organization and no other. See restrictions below.

## Special Rules

### User Deletion

**Super admins** can delete any user, with these restrictions:

- Cannot delete yourself
- Cannot delete the last super admin

**Org admins** can delete a user only when all of the following are true:

- The target user is not a super admin
- The target user belongs to the admin's current organization
- The target user belongs to **only one organization** (the admin's org)

If the target user belongs to multiple organizations, admins can **remove them from the organization** instead of deleting them entirely.
